Installing VirtualBox was the fun easy hard part.
I got it installed any number of times, 
but I had missed an essential previous step or two
and had run into frustration not being able to get my virtual machine
up and running.

I may be in error, but I believe the instructions
in the included course file are woefully incomplete.

I'm on Ubuntu 18.04.
These are the instructions I used after the
course provided instructions had
frustrated me for more than one day 
and I walked away from it for a few days.

First run an apt update and apt upgrade.
This seems standard and makes sense, right?

'''sudo apt update'''
'''sudo apt upgrade'''

This is taking a few minutes.

This is the part here that is not in the course instructions...

"Now, import the Oracle public key to your system signed the Debian packages using the following commands."

I'm WHAT?

Check out page one of Environment-Setup.pdf
then chuck it and use the link I provided instead.

Next command I'm running:

'''wget -q https://www.virtualbox.org/download/oracle_vbox_2016.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -'''

Then:

'''wget -q https://www.virtualbox.org/download/oracle_vbox.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -'''

And:

'''sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian bionic contrib"'''

Finally, to install a version suitable for the project,
use the command 

'''sudo apt install virtualbox-5.2'''

PLEASE NOTICE that you have changed the command provided from 6.0 to 5.2

VirtualBox should now be installed.
I use the icon on my app screen to access it
but you can also use the command 
virtualbox
