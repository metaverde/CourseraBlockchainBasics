# CourseraBlockchainBasics
A hopefully helpful description of how to complete the final project for the Coursera "Blockchain Basics" course. 
Includes installing VirtualBox with a Linux vm and running Ethereum nodes.
I'm running Linux 18.04 that I installed dual boot on a Windows laptop.

This should be a link to the course:
https://www.coursera.org/learn/blockchain-basics/home/info

A lot of the purpose here is to gain facility with GitHub, 
but also I've noticed support for this course is almost non-existent.
It took a few tries, mostly because I jumped into things.
I had to uninstall re-install a few times.
Instructions for that will be included.
