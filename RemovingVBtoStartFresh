This may not be the most popular view, but 
when I've run into trouble with an install 
I like to purge the whole thing and start over.

I'm not saying don't troubleshoot,
but if you've checked a few things and
tried a couple more, why not
start over fresh and see if you didn't miss a step?

In this case I had to search out a tutorial
and really pay attention and do it step by step.

I'm assuming whomever is reading this has 
already frustrated his or her self 
multiple times attempting this exercise with 
the supplied instructions.

So let's do this thing.

I got the command from 
[here](https://rtmccormick.com/2018/03/03/remove-virtualbox-ubuntu-16-04-xenial/)
and I'm going to cut right to the chase.
You want to actually purge the VB from your system
not just uninstall and remove various files and directories.

sudo apt-get remove virtualbox* --purge

"Removing virtualbox-5.2 (5.2.38-136252~Ubuntu~bionic) ..."
Oh interesting... I accidentally installed 5.2.38 instead of 5.2.22.
Maybe that's why it worked.

After making sure I was in the home directory I run ls -al
and looked for a “VirtualBox VMs” directory.

drwx------   3 petra petra      4096 Mar 12 16:00 'VirtualBox VMs'

I removed that with rm -rf ./"VirtualBox VMs".

Now I go into my .config directory and double-check
that the previous purge command removed the VirtualBox file there
and it did not!

drwx------  2 petra petra 4096 Mar 19 12:55 VirtualBox

So I run rm -rf ./VirtualBox and check again, using ls -al 
from inside the directory .config,
and it is removed.

Now I am ready to reinstall.
